# Contributing to halo-api
Contributions are appreciated and there are multiple ways to do so:

- Reporting a bug
- Proposing new features
- Submitting a fix/feature
- Participate in discussions

## [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) is our preferred workflow
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Update the documentation when applicable.
4. Ensure all tests pass.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Submit the pull request!

## Report bugs using the issues tab
We use issues to track bugs and requested features. Create either of these by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/EthanGrahn/halo-api/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary
- Steps to reproduce
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes if you have done investigating

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
The project uses ESLint to maintain code style. Most IDEs will show errors and warnings using the `.eslint` file automatically. Otherwise, you can use `npm run lint` occasionally to verify your code.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its ISC License.

## References
This project is a wrapper for the official [Halo API](https://developer.haloapi.com) and new features should make sense in that context.
